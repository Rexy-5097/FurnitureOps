## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1.  **Do NOT** open a public issue.
2.  Email the maintainers directly at [support@furnitureops.com](mailto:support@furnitureops.com) (or the repository owner).
3.  Include a Proof of Concept (PoC) if possible.
4.  We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.

## Security Best Practices

- **MFA**: Multi-Factor Authentication is recommended for all admin accounts.
- **Least Privilege**: Ensure API keys have minimal scopes.
- **Dependencies**: We scan dependencies regularly for CVEs.
